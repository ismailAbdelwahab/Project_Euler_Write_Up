 NOTE: fibo[] is as:  fibo[0] + fibo[1] = fibo[2]
          we will note them as A + B = C

 We need to add C if C is even.
    if A and B are: both even or both odd    ==> C is even
	 if A and B have not the same parity     ==> C is odd

 We see a patern in the fibonacci sequence: ("E" is even numbers and "O" odd ones)
   0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 ...
   E O O E O O E O  O  E  O  O  ...     The sequence is : ( E O O )

So, after an EVEN number, we need to wait 2 ODD numbers before finding another EVEN number.

Solution:
We start our tab at the state where fibo[2] is the first even number(beside 0).
 ( fibo = [1,1,2] ) 

1) we add fibo[2] in our answer
2) we calculate the next 3 fibo numbers before adding again in our answer
