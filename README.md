# Project_Euler_Write_Up

When i feel like it, i try to solve some of these problems.

Remember that these solution may not be the best, but they work!
 Do not use this code just to have the answer to a problem.
 
Try to understand what is done and why! This way, i hope you will learn as much as you can.
## Repo's architecture:
- Python_code/ ----> { Contains Python code }
  - Problem XX: Will be solved in the file *XX_prob.py*
  - If *XX_prob.py* does not exist, i did not solved it yet ;D
- README.md ----> { This current file }

## Error or issues:
 Feel free to add issues on problems if there is an obvious amelioration,
should that be in **complexity**,**code presentation**,**repetitivity** etc...
