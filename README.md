# Project_Euler_Write_Up

When i feel like it, i try to solve some of these problems.

Remember that these solutions may not be the best, but they work!

 **Do not use this code just to have the answer to a problem.**
 
Try to understand what is done and why! This way, i hope you will learn as much as you can.
## Repo's architecture:
- XXX/ ---------------------------------------------------> { Folder of the problem n°XXX }
  - *X_prob*.py -----------------> { Code that solves the problem n°X }
  - *XXX_prob_explication*.txt --> { Some text to explain what i did in the code}
  - *filename*.txt --------------> { Some data needed by the code }
- README.md ----------------------------------------------> { This current file }

## Error or issues:
 Feel free to add issues on problems if there is an obvious amelioration,
should that be in **complexity**,**code presentation**,**repetitivity** etc...
