    We need to find an int that is evenly divisible by all numbers
from 1 to 20.

Be our "int tested" named X

    After a little reflexion, we see that just need to check if X is divisible by all
prime numbers between 1 and 20.

Which are 19 - 17 - 13 - 11 - 7 - 5 - 3 - 2.

Now we know that our number is a multiple of all of these number.

    So by brute force, we are going to try all of them,
from the first one which is : 19*17*13*11*7*5*3*2


    Each time we will add this number to our tested int, until X is divisible 
by all number from 1 to 20.

    This represents a lot of test. So we can try to lower the 
number of tests we are going to make.

Easely we see that if X%4==0 then X%2==0 too.
So we do not need to test if X is divisible by 4 if it is already by 2.

    So: beeing divisible by 1 up to 20 is equivalent to be divisible by 11 up to 20,
as all numbers from 11 to 20 are divisible at least by one numbers between 1 and 10
 without any number omitted.

So if X is divisible by 11 -> 20,
that implicates that X is divisible by 1 -> 20
The first condition is sufficent
