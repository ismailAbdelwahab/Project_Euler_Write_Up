	isPrime(n, list_of_primes):
We are trying to see if a number(NAMED "N") is prime or not.

To check if N is prime,
We just need to check if it is NOT divisible (evenly) by
any previous prime number (the ones that are lower than N).

The condition above is sufficent to say that N is prime.
But we can go further and reduce the number of test we are doing.

Any number that is superior to N/2 will not divide evenly N anyway.

So in our function we only test, all prime numbers up to N/2 as divisors.

	Core program:
It is obvious that even numbers are not prime.
they have at least : 1, 2, and themselves as divisors.

So in our loop on the variable "number", we only test ODD numbers.
	"number" starts at 1.
	and we increment "number" by 2 each time.

We wait until counter is at 10001 and we print our number to see,
who is the 10001'st prime number.
