Every number can be written as a multiplication of prime numbers 
    (these are his prime factors) Like:

  1 * 2 * 5 * 13  = 130

we need to find pX as :
 p1 * p2 * p3 * p4 * .... * pX == myNumber


    We declare value = 1.
So : (value) * p1 * p2 * p3 ... * pX == myNumber
So : (value * p1) * ( p2 * p3 ... * pX ) == myNumber
        .
        .
        .
So : (value * p1 * p2 * p3 ... * pX-1) * ( pX ) == myNumber

A prime factor (named pN) is found if : myNumber % pN == 0

As we find a prime factor we are multiplying value by this factor,
   Then we continue until value == myNumber


The last prime factor found is the answer to our question.
